# About this book

This book tells the story of CAR T-cell therapy for the treatment of leukemia. I decided to write this book as a fun way to highlight the science behind this exciting technology. 

I also hope this book brings attention to the fact that there is much more work to do to push the frontier of science and improve outcomes for cancer patients.
